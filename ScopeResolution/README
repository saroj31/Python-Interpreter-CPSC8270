Project description: Python Functions & Scope

Difficulties: 
			1. Removing the Segmentatin Fault
			2. In making the Table Manager
			3. I have made the SymbolTable for different scope possible.
			4. My Output so far is below:-
				x=4
				print x
				4
				def FOO():
					    x=6
						print x 
				print x
				4	
				FOO()
				6
			5. Please FInd attached the screenshots  of my results.
			

Extra:   1. Made the change in production rule by adding the factored grammar funcdef1 at line number 102. This makes the code more
			easier to track the FunctionName
		 2. I will add more correction later. To add the fucntion Node and handle all operations.
