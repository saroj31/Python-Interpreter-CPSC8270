Project description: Introduction to an Interpreter for Python 2.7.2

Difficulties: 	1. Handing of Parentheses was difficult to find as we had many instances like that of functions
				2. Handled the integer division
				3. To figure out the way to make the testcases and thus understanding the python code.
						

Extra:   Handled the zero division error too even through the test cases.you will be able to see it in the test cases of AllDiv.py file.
